        "content": "Paiute sentence structure is quite flexible, but it generally centers around the verb. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Verb-Centric Structure**: The verb is often the central element of the sentence, carrying multiple suffixes that indicate tense, aspect, and mood.\n\n2. **Word Order**: While the word order can vary, pronominal subjects often appear after the first word of the clause. This means that the subject can be separated from the initial constituent of the clause.\n\n3. **Suffixes**: Verbs can have suffixes for tense (e.g., past, present), aspect (e.g., perfective), and mood (e.g., modal).\n\n4. **Accusative Case**: Objects in a sentence are marked with an accusative suffix, which helps to identify them as the object of the verb.\n\n5. **Complex Sentences**: Paiute allows for complex sentence structures, including complement clauses that function as the subject or object of a verb.\n\nOverall, the structure is quite dynamic, allowing for various stylistic and grammatical expressions."
